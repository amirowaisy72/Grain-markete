//connect to user collection
  const connection = async () => {
    //API Call
    const response = await fetch(`${host}/connect-to-mongo`, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ username: 'Zameendara' }),
    })
    const json = await response.json()
    return json
  }

this is my fetch API in reactjs component.
